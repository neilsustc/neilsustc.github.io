## "Version control" of myself

<blockquote>Once you can name something, you’re conscious of it. You have power over it.

There is a hypothesis named [linguistic relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity) whose principle holds that the structure of a language affects its speakers' world view or cognition.

Sometimes we solve problems using intuition. Maybe that is because it's difficult for us in finding an accurate word to describe it. With no explicit definition of what we care about, we cannot figure out how to do even what to do. (maybe mathematics are the most accurate 'words', for which most modern scientific theories are based on it.)

There are too many things of which I have no concept, in other words, I even cannot name them. **There are always lots of knowledge to learn**.

When talked about cognition, the [curse of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge) is an interesting cognitive bias. That is, if you know about something, you will be hard to think from the perspective of who don't know that. That is really interesting. Since we know more and more things, maybe you even cannot understand the one you were. ([List of cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases))

Bias always exists because there are too much we don't know, and in the other hand, we have already known too much.

**Recognizing yourself is really hard**.
